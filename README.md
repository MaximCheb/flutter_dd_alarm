A small flutter pet project for creating several types of alarm clocks

# Classic alarm clock

A regular alarm clock that repeats every day, or every few days, depending on the selected day of the week.

# Scheduled calendar alarm clock

It will be possible to set the start and end date of the schedule, repeat once a week, several weeks or days, with a table of alarms.

# GPS alarm clock

It alarms when you hit the set area, it is useful when you regularly fall asleep on public transport.
